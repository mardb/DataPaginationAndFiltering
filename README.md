# Pagination

Welcome! This project is written with "vanilla" **JavaScript** and I will be doing some (DOM manipulation) and using “pagination” to enhance the usability of an existing  web page.

You will see:
A display the first set nine students on the page as well as navigation or pagination buttons so that user can click to display different pages of students.
